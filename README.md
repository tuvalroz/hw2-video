## Intro
This is an example of a blog website. Use cases:
1. Authenticate with [oAuth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT8ybowdyr0) in front of Github.
2. Get a list of posts from an external database.
3. Some posts are private drafts, and can only be seen by the author.
4. Some posts are public, and can be seen by all users.

This example shows how to implement a **fullstack app in TypeScript with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** using [React](https://reactjs.org/) (frontend), [Next.js API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) and [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client) (backend). It also demonstrates how to implement authentication using [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/). The example uses an SQLite database file with some initial dummy data which you can find at [`./prisma/dev.db`](./prisma/dev.db).

## Prerequirements

-Prisma: To understand how to use the Prisma mySQL database, 
it is recommended to open a new directory, and go through the [prisma database tutorial](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart).
-Git: understand its [basics](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/):
--what is a repository. 
--how to clone it.
--make edits to it.
--and push it to a new repository owned by you.

-Github: the hw1 will be submitted via github. Please open a user for your BGU email address, at:
https://github.com/

and be able to securely update files from your machine, by ssh authentication:
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys 


## The task
The task is to add [pagination](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_pagination.asp) to the website.
In order to test that your implementation works, you'll also have to populate your databases with fake posts.

This app contains material that we haven't seen yet in class, such as server side rendering, and static site generation.

## Getting started

### 1. Download example and install dependencies

Download this example:

```bash
npx try-prisma@latest --template typescript/rest-nextjs-api-routes-auth
```

Install npm dependencies:

```bash
cd rest-nextjs-api-routes-auth
npm install
```

<details><summary><strong>Alternative:</strong> Clone the entire repo</summary>

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:prisma/prisma-examples.git --depth=1
```

Install npm dependencies:

```bash
cd prisma-examples/typescript/rest-nextjs-api-routes-auth
npm install
```

</details>

### 2. Create and seed the database

Run the following command to create your SQLite database file. This also creates the `User` and `Post` tables that are defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma):

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

When `npx prisma migrate dev` is executed against a newly created database, seeding is also triggered. The seed file in [`prisma/seed.ts`](./prisma/seed.ts) will be executed and your database will be populated with the sample data.

### 3. Configuring your authentication provider

In order to get this example to work, you need to configure the [GitHub](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/github) and/or [Email](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/email) authentication providers from NextAuth.js.

#### Configuring the GitHub authentication provider

<details><summary>Expand to learn how you can configure the GitHub authentication provider</summary>

First, log into your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

Then, navigate to [**Settings**](https://github.com/settings/profile), then open to [**Developer Settings**](https://github.com/settings/apps), then switch to [**OAuth Apps**](https://github.com/settings/developers).

![Github Developer Settings: OAuth Apps](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fBiGBXbE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/4eQrMAs.png)

Clicking on the **Register a new application** button will redirect you to a registration form to fill out some information for your app. The **Authorization callback URL** should be the Next.js `/api/auth` route.

An important thing to note here is that the **Authorization callback URL** field only supports a single URL, unlike e.g. Auth0, which allows you to add additional callback URLs separated with a comma. This means if you want to deploy your app later with a production URL, you will need to set up a new GitHub OAuth app.

![Github: Register a new OAuth application](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--v7s0OEs_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/tYtq5fd.png)

Click on the **Register application** button, and then you will be able to find your newly generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Copy and paste this info into the [`.env`](./env) file in the root directory.

The resulting section in the `.env` file might look like this:

```env
# GitHub oAuth
GITHUB_ID=6bafeb321963449bdf51
GITHUB_SECRET=509298c32faa283f28679ad6de6f86b2472e1bff
```

</details>

#### Configuring the Email authentication provider

You can [follow the instructions in the NextAuth.js documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/email#configuration) to configure the Email authentication provider. Once your email authentication provider is configured, you can set the environment variables in [`.env`](./env) accordingly.

### 4. Start the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app is now running, navigate to [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to explore its UI.

## Evolving the app

Evolving the application typically requires three steps:

1. Migrate your database using Prisma Migrate
1. Update your server-side application code
1. Build new UI features in React

For the following example scenario, assume you want to add a "profile" feature to the app where users can create a profile and write a short bio about themselves.

### 1. Migrate your database using Prisma Migrate

The first step is to add a new table, e.g. called `Profile`, to the database. You can do this by adding a new model to your [Prisma schema file](./prisma/schema.prisma) file and then running a migration afterwards:

```diff
// schema.prisma

model Post {
  id        Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean @default(false)
  author    User?   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int
}

model User {
  id      Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id 
  name    String? 
  email   String   @unique
  posts   Post[]
+ profile Profile?
}

+model Profile {
+  id     Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
+  bio    String?
+  userId Int     @unique
+  user   User    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
+}
```

Once you've updated your data model, you can execute the changes against your database with the following command:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 2. Update your application code

You can now use your `PrismaClient` instance to perform operations against the new `Profile` table. Here are some examples:

#### Create a new profile for an existing user

```ts
const profile = await prisma.profile.create({
  data: {
    bio: "Hello World",
    user: {
      connect: { email: "alice@prisma.io" },
    },
  },
});
```

#### Create a new user with a new profile

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: "john@prisma.io",
    name: "John",
    profile: {
      create: {
        bio: "Hello World",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

#### Update the profile of an existing user

```ts
const userWithUpdatedProfile = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { email: "alice@prisma.io" },
  data: {
    profile: {
      update: {
        bio: "Hello Friends",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### 3. Build new UI features in React

Once you have added a new endpoint to the API (e.g. `/api/profile` with `/POST`, `/PUT` and `GET` operations), you can start building a new UI component in React. It could e.g. be called `profile.tsx` and would be located in the `pages` directory.

In the application code, you can access the new endpoint via `fetch` operations and populate the UI with the data you receive from the API calls.

## Switch to another database (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB)

If you want to try this example with another database than SQLite, you can adjust the the database connection in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma) by reconfiguring the `datasource` block.

Learn more about the different connection configurations in the [docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/connection-urls).

<details><summary>Expand for an overview of example configurations with different databases</summary>

### PostgreSQL

For PostgreSQL, the connection URL has the following structure:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=SCHEMA"
}
```

Here is an example connection string with a local PostgreSQL database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/notesapi?schema=public"
}
```

### MySQL

For MySQL, the connection URL has the following structure:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = "mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
}
```

Here is an example connection string with a local MySQL database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = "mysql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:3306/notesapi"
}
```

### Microsoft SQL Server

Here is an example connection string with a local Microsoft SQL Server database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlserver"
  url      = "sqlserver://localhost:1433;initial catalog=sample;user=sa;password=mypassword;"
}
```

### MongoDB

Here is an example connection string with a local MongoDB database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mongodb"
  url      = "mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE?authSource=admin&retryWrites=true&w=majority"
}
```
